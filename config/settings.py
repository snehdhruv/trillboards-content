Trillboards â€” context for generation
â€¢ What it is: Trillboards turns any TV into a programmable screen for local promos and short ads. It's software-only (no hardware box).
â€¢ Who uses it:
  - EARNER (screen owner or staff at a venue) pairs a TV and schedules rotating cards (house specials, events, community notices) plus optional paid local promos.
  - ADVERTISER (brand or local biz) books time on those screens.
â€¢ How it works (typical flow):
  1. Open the Trillboards app on phone.
  2. Pair the TV by scanning a QR code at screen.trillboards.com.
  3. Choose a playlist template (bar specials, class fill, neighborhood bundle, lobby info, etc.).
  4. Set rotation (e.g., every 5â€“8 minutes) and quiet hours.
  5. (Optional) Add paid local promos from the marketplace.
  6. Let it run; swap cards on the fly from the app.
â€¢ Positioning (for scripts): Trillboards is a tool in the workflowâ€”the quiet step that solves "how do we actually put this on a screen and keep it rotating without babysitting?"
â€¢ Money reality: EARNERs can receive small, variable daily payouts or CPM-based earnings when demand exists. Ranges depend on foot traffic, hours, location, and fill rate. Avoid promises; use plausible ranges and hedges.
â€¢ Prefer "local promos," "offers," "events," "sign-ups" language over "ads."
